title: Hey there!

I'm Pema. I write code - sometimes. I'm particularly interested in graphics,
virtual reality, programming language development, functional programming and
pure mathematics. I'm currently working on Lighting at Unity.
Check out [my stuff](https://github.com/pema99), if you want, and feel free to reach
out on any socials.

I'm trying to slowly turn this website into a [blog](archive.md).
More content to come in the future.

- Extending the multicore C backend of the [Futhark](https://github.com/pema99/futhark) compiler to emit [ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html) code.
- My toy language, [Bonk](https://github.com/pema99/bonk).

# Noteworthy projects
- [Raytracer](https://github.com/pema99/Raytracer), a fairly fleshed out CPU-based path tracer.
- [LotusNES](https://github.com/pema99/LotusNES), an NES emulator written in C#. It runs Battletoads!
- [Bonk](https://github.com/pema99/bonk), my functional ML-like toy language.
- [Shader Knowledge](https://github.com/pema99/shader-knowledge), where I share VRChat specific shader trickery.
- [glsl2hlsl](https://pema99.github.io/glsl2hlsl), a tool for converting ShaderToy shaders to working Unity shaders.
- [Shaderception](https://github.com/pema99/Shaderception), a shader compiler and runtime that runs entirely within VRChat.
